question: How do I do hot module reloading?
---

We recommend using [HamberKit](https://hamberjs-kit.web.app/), which supports HMR out of the box and is built on top of [Lahm](https://lahmjs.web.app/) and [hamber-hmr](https://github.com/hamberjs/hamber-hmr). There are also community plugins for [rollup](https://github.com/hamberjs/rollup-plugin-hamber-hot) and [webpack](https://github.com/hamberjs/hamber-loader).
