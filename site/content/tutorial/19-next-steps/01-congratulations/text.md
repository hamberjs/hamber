You've now finished the Hamber tutorial and are ready to start building apps. You can refer back to individual chapters at any time (click the title above to reveal a dropdown) or continue your learning via the [API reference](/docs), [Examples](/examples) and [Blog](/blog).

To get set up in your local development environment, check out [the quickstart guide](/docs#getting-started).

If you're looking for a more expansive framework that includes routing, server-side rendering and everything else, take a look at [HamberKit](https://hamberjs-kit.web.app).
